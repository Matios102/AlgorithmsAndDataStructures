// You take part in a single-player game.
// At the beginning your pawn is placed in the first field of a one-dimensional board consisting of n fields enumerated from 1 to n.
// Some fields of this board, except the first 1 and the last n, may contain a hole.
// You roll a standard (with six sides) dice and move your pawn toward the last field by the number of dots seen on the dice.
// You lose if you fell into a hole or jumped over field n. You win if you moved the pawn to field n.
// Write a program that counts the number of sequences of dice rolls that lead to your win. 

// Input
// The first line contains integer z (1 <= z <= 2*10^9) - the number of data sets.
// Each dat set is as follows:
// The first line contains the number n (1 <= n <= 10000) denoting the size of the board and the number m (1 â‰¤ m < 10000).
// The second line contains n numbers from the set {0, 1}, separated by space, determining whether the subsequent fields of the board contain a hole (denoted by 0).

// Output
// The number of sequences of dice rolls that lead to the win (taken modulo m).
